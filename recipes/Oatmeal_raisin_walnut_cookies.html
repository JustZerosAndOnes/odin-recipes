                <li>1 1/2 cups California Walnuts, divided</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>12 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                <li>2/3 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/3 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 egg, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups rolled oats (not quick or instant)</li>
                <li>3/4 cup raisins</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Rough chop 1 cup walnuts in a food processor. Add remaining walnuts and pulse 2 to 3 times to coarsely chop.</li>
                <li>Mix together flour, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
                <li>Cream together butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until light and fluffy In a stand mixer fitted with 
                    paddle attachment (or a hand mixer), scraping down sides of the bowl once or twice. Add vanilla and egg; beat on low until just combined.</li>
                <li>Add dry ingredients and beat on low until just combined. Stir in oats, then stir in walnuts and raisins. Cover and chill for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 325°F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Scoop batter into 1⁄4 cup size balls using an ice cream scoop 
                    and place on prepared baking sheets leaving plenty of room for dough to spread. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, turning tray halfway through 
                    baking, or until lightly browned on the sides and top. Cool for at least 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling. 
                    Store in an airtight container.</li>
                <li>Note: To make ahead, scoop the batter once it is done and store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 7 days, or freeze 
                    for up to a month. Place frozen dough on tray and let stand at room temperature for 10 to 20 minutes before baking.</li>
            </ol>
